# accessbility-indicators

## Project Overview

This project builds on the previous work on urban indicators and extends it further for different category of districts. The aim is to categorize districts based on existing data and come up with ways to compare these category of districts against one another.

## Previous Work

[Urbanization Analysis India](https://github.com/ChahatBansal8060/Urbanization_Analysis_India) - This project uses available datasets of satellite imagery and road information to develop a series of standardized indicators for different aspects of urbanization, which can serve to compare various cities with one another and to track change happening in the cities over time. The project also classifies district grids into Urban, PeriUrban and Rural categories which is used in the next project.

[Urban Indicators India](https://github.com/ICTD-IITD/Urban_indicators_India) - This project defines and builds various urban indicators using the classification from above project and population data.

Kindly visit these repositories to get an understanding of the previous work.

## Directory Structure

* Data - This directory contains two directories: Input_Data and Places. Input_Data folder contains the processed data required to be used as inputs for calculating indicators. One large input data file has been omitted here since GitHub doesn't support that. You can visit and download the data [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uCh1amKcQ9zjYZBFY65E09MXHICG2uA1/view?usp=sharing). Places folder has some raw data for reference of the reader.

* Results - Contains all results for all three classifications.

* Code - This directory contains python files converted from google collab notebooks in the order of intended execution. These also contain files from the previous work repositories. The changes made by us are in the #11 and #12 scripts.
